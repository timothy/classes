    CONSOLE APPLICATION : classes Project Overview
========================================================================
I am just going over some simple syntax and reviewing and testing some functionality.
This is not meant to be a serous bank app but is just me playing with some c++...


========================================================================
    Lessons Learned
========================================================================
1. when overloading functions/methods always try to reuse a base
 function/method within overloads. this will prevent duplicate work when
  you need to make simple changes...

2. if I really want to refresh my C++ syntax of classes I should
 probably not try to use an abstract money class... I am getting lost in money
  details and not focusing on my gaol of learning syntax.
