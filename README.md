# classes
This is a simple C++ class syntax example - made by Timothy

I wanted to refresh my C++ snytax and skills... I did this to go over some basic C++ class syntax as a refresh.

1. when overloading functions/methods always try to reuse a base function/method within overloads. this will prevent duplicate work when you need to make simple changes...

2. if I really want to refresh my C++ syntax of classes I should probably not try to use an abstract money class... I am getting lost in money details and not focusing on my gaol of learning syntax.
